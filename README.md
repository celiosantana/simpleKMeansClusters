# simpleKMeansClusters
Toy example using Iris Dataset (Flowers) of Clusterization using KMeans in Python

**celiosantana/simpleKMeansCluster** is a reposit√≥riy presenting a small example of using Kmeans clusterization in Python (Sklearn library)


The main idea is to find and categorize flowers, which data is presented in a world wide knowed dataset iris. This data set is composed of 150 flowers presenting its petal width, petal length, sepal width, sepal length and variety of each flower. There are 3 classes of flowers, Setosa, Virginic and Versicolor.

The Idea is to cluster the flowers based on their petal length and width, and later by their sepal lenght and width, and find the clusters, that should be coincident with theur variety.

The code is in python and use Sklearn library to use Kmeans
